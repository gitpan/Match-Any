=head1 NAME

  Regexp::Match::Any - Match many regexes against a variable


=head1 CHANGES

  Version 0.02: Pass match_any() both arrays and array references


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Regexp::Match::Any;
  my @array = qw(foo bar wibble);
  my $var = "foo";
  if($var =~ match_any(\@array)){
    print "It matched\n";
  }else{
    print "It didn't match\n";
  }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

  This module allows you to pass the match_any() function an array of regexs (or reference to the array)
  and then will match the variable against any of them. This is quite handy for things such as
  swear word listings or to use regexs stored within a file or database. For good programming
  practice you should always pass an array reference.
