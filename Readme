NAME

  Regexp::Match::Any - Match many regexes against a variable


SYNOPSIS

  use Regexp::Match::Any;
  my @array = qw(foo bar wibble);
  my $var = "foo";
  if($var =~ match_any(@array)){
    print "It matched\n";
  }else{
    print "It didn't match\n";
  }


DESCRIPTION

  This module allows you to pass the match_any() function an array of regexs and then will
  match the variable against any of them. This is quite handy for things such as swear word 
  listings or to use regexs stored within a file or database.
